# Space-Missions-Data-Exploration
This is my third project in the Udacity/ALX-T Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. The project, Communicate Data Findings, is focused on demonstrating the importance and value of data visualization (both exploratory and explanatory) techniques in the data analysis process choosing one's own dataset or a Udacity-curated dataset.
